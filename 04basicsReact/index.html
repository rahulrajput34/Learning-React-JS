  What we gonna learn?
  -- we have created our own react in another folder named react 3
  -- we need only two thing, one is object and second one is function to render on the page
  -- so, we created one object and one function which gonna do work like a react (render html by js like react )
  -- then we write App method in main directory and it works.
  -- it also works if we pass App() insted of <App/>
  -- then we stored html in one varibale and then passed and it's works
  -- Then we passed our created object but it not works
  --  Our objects is not works that is why we created React element and passed varibale and all according to format ( it is injected by babble transpiler)
  -- than we passed it in main and it works
  -- Then we go on github and explore js libary (we can explore it if we want to know about something new but it's not easy task for beginners)
  -- From this video , we more familer with react and get to know about how react works behind the scene
