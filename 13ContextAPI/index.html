<!-- What we gonna learn inside this lecture?? -->
 <!-- 
   We gonna learn the  steps of creating and using Context API
   - we first created the file of js for creating context api
   - wrap to all component we created context provider and wrap all the componet
   - then we created Login component and give our props to context API
   - then we cerated Profile Component and get access of all the component whcih is present

   ==>  
   -- from login component we passed props named username and userpassword to the globale context and in Profile componet we access username and userpassword from globle context
   -- this is what we did inside this project
