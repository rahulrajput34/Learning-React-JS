<!-- History of Redux -->
<!-- Redux is the independed library which have many parts. For our redux we gonna use react-redux  -->
<!-- Redux se bhi phle Flux aaya tha for solving the problem of prop drilling -->
<!-- Flux na under dataflow was good, how props gonna store in one area and how they come out of it is good  -->
<!-- But the dataFlow system was not that much better -->
<!-- Then we invented redux which is better than flux in dataflows -->
<!-- Redux used in almost all the framework of JS -->
<!-- Redux was good but it has some problems  like its take too much time to setup -->
<!-- Then we move onto the concept of redux-toolkit which has easy to setup and has most of proprtoies of the redux -->


<!-- In redux we have 4 thing 
 1. store
 2. reducers  
 3. useSelector  -- value select karni ho
 4. useDispatch  -- value bhejni ho -->
